[Description:]

This fix adds the elastic force onto the atoms in group, which incorporate
the full elastic response of semi-infinite solids in a way that only surface atoms have
to be considered in molecular dynamics simulations;
for theoretical details, see ("Campa&ntilde;&aacute;"_#campana, "Kong"_#kong).

At each timestep, this fix transforms the atomic displacements from real
space into reciprocal space by calling the FFT3d wrapper from "kspace package"_kspace_style.html of LAMMPS
and then computes the reciprocal forces by multipling the reciprocal displacement vector by
the effective elastic coefficients (&Phi; matrix); the reciprocal forces are then transformed
back into the real space and applied onto the corresponding atoms.

The formulas below show schematically the above described procedure:
<center>[{u}]([q]) = FFT [u]([r])</center>
<center>[{f}]([q]) = -[&Phi;]([q])[{u}]([q])</center>
<center>[f]([r]) = rFFT [{f}]([q])</center>

For the use of keywords {su}, {sv}, {origin}, and {map}, please refer to the document of
"fix gfc"_fix_gfc.html.

If keyword {load} is specified, extra force will be applied to the {last} dimension for
all atoms in the group; alternatively, one can also use "fix addforce"_fix_addforce.html
to add the extra force.

If keyword {output} is specified, the instantaneous elastic force acting on the atoms
in group will be written to file "prefix"."timestep" every N time steps, where "prefix"
will be replaced by the command option {prefix} and "timestep" by the current time step
number; the elastic force will also be written after the last step of the run. 
No information of the elastic force will be output if the keyword {output} is not set.

If keyword {reset_xeq} = {none}, the equilibrium position of atoms in the Green's function
slab, which serve as the references to evaluate the displacements,  will be determined as
specified by {style}; if {reset_xeq} = {all}, the equilibrium positions will be reset based
on the surface lattice information read from the binary file produced by "fix gfc"_fix_gfc.html;
if {reset_xeq} = {last}, only the last dimension of the equilibrium positions will be reset.

If keyword {reset_f} = {yes}, the forces acting on atoms in group will be zeroed
before adding the elastic forces.

During the measurement of the effective elastic coefficients, the acoustic sum rule is
not strictly satisfied. An iterative procedure is therefore employed to enforce the
acoustic sum rule on &Phi; at &Gamma;, and the keyword {nasr} is used to define the
number of iterations. For system whose surface unit cell has only one atom, {nasr} = 1
is sufficient, while for other cases, {nasr} = 20 should be enough.

The initialization information will be written to file gfmd."prefix".log,
in which one can find the mapping information between the atom ID and the lattice indices;
usually for a continuous run, the computation of the mapping based on
surface vectors will be unsuccessful, and the mapping information will need to be read
from file via the {map} keyword.

For a restart run, atoms in the Green's function layer usually do not stay at their
equilibrium positions, one would better provide the original/equilibrium positions
(via style {1} or {3}) and the mapping information (via keyword {map}) by input files.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart file"_restart.html.
None of the fix_modify options are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a 3-vector of forces, which can be accessed by various
"output"_Section_howto.html#4_15 commands. This is the total force on the group of
atoms before the forces on individual atoms are changed by this fix. The vector values
calculated by this fix are "extensive", meaning they scale with the number of atoms
in the simulation. 

Besides, this fix will also output its own initialization information, and elastic forces
if keyword {output} is specified.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the start/stop keywords of the
"run"_run.html command.

This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix assumes that the atoms in group are from one or several surface layers of a
semi-infinite solids with periodical boundary conditions in the lateral dimensions.

[Related commands:]

"fix gfc"_fix_gfc.html, "fix addforce"_fix_addforce.html

[Note:]

Compiling of this fix along with LAMMPS requires that the "FFT3d wrapper of kspace package"_kspace_style.html
is included while compiling.

[Default:]
The option defaults are {load} = 0.0, {output} = 0 (no output), {reset_xeq} = none, {reset_f} = no, {nasr} = 15.
