The files in this directory are a user-contributed package for LAMMPS.

This package implements the Green's function molecular dynamics, by
introducing two more fixes to LAMMPS. The first one, FixGFC, is used
to measure the effective elastic stiffness coefficients based on the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The second one, FixGFMD, is used to
evaluate the effective elastic forces by using the elastic stiffness
coefficients.

See the documentation files of these commands for detailed usage.

The compiling of this package along with LAMMPS requires the FFT3d wrappers
from the kspace package of LAMMPS be included as well. An example of the
Makefile is also available in this directory.

Besides, you should also append 'user-gfmd' to the 'PACKUSER' variable
in the file of src/Makefile before invoke `make yes-user-gfmd`.
