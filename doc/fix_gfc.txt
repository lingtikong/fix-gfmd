[Description:]

Compute the effective elatic stiffness coefficients based on fluctuation-dissipation
theory for a group of atoms (in the examples above of group 'bottom').

Based on fluctuation-dissipation theory, the elastic stiffness coefficients
are given by
<center>&Phi;<sub>&alpha;,&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) = k<sub>B</sub>T
<b>G</b><sup>-1</sup><sub>&alpha;,&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>),</center>

where [G] is the Green's functions coefficients given by

<center><b>G</b><sub>&alpha;,&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) =
<<b>u</b><sub>&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<b>u</b><sub>&beta;</sub><sup>*</sup>(<b>q</b>)>.</center>

Here [u]<sub>&alpha;</sub>([q]) is the &alpha; component of the
atomic displacement in the reciprocal space at [q]. In practice, the Green's
functions coefficients can also be measured according to the following formula,

<center><b>G</b><sub>&alpha;,&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) =
<<b>R</b><sub>&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<b>R</b><sup>*</sup><sub>&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>)>
- <<b>R</b>><sub>&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<<b>R</b>><sup>*</sup><sub>&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>),
</center>

where [R] is the instantaneous positions of atoms, and <[R]> is
the averaged atomic positions. It gives essentially the same
results as the displacement method and is easier to implement into an MD code.


This fix observes the positions of atoms in the corresponding group and the two-point
correlations. To achieve this the positions of the atoms are recorded every Nevery
steps and are Fourier-transformed (with "FFT3d wrapper"_kspace_style.html from kspace
package of LAMMPS) into reciprocal space, in which the averaging process and correlation
computation is then done. After every {Noutput} measurements, the matrix [G]([q]) is
calculated and inverted to get the effective elastic stiffness coefficients. The
resulting matrix elements
[&Phi;]<sub>&alpha;,&beta;</sub>([q]) are written to
file "prefix".bin."timestep" in binary format and to file "prefix".log for
each wavevector [q].

A detailed description of this method and its application to contact
mechanics can be found in ("Campa&ntilde;&aacute;"_#campana , "Kong"_#kong).

If the {map} keyword is specified, the code will try to read the
mapping information between lattice indices and atom IDs from the
file provided; in this case, keywords {su}, {sv} and {origin}
will be ignored.

If the {su} and/or {sv} keywords are specified while {map}
is not, the code will try to compute the mapping information
based on the surface vectors provided; otherwise the surface vector will be
deduced from the lattice information, while can be defined via  the
"lattice"_lattice.html command.

If there are more than one atoms in a surface unit cell, one need to
provide the mapping information via keyworkd {map}, since it is difficult
for the code to compute it with the surface vectors in hand only; an exception
is when there are two atoms in a surface unit cell
and one of them sits on the lattice site while the other at the
lattice center.

Keyword {origin} is used to make sure that the surface origin remains
the same for both elastic stiffness coefficients measurement by
this fix and subsequent Green's Function molecular dynamics by "fix gfmd"_fix_gfmd.html,
when there are more than one atoms in a surface unit cell and that these atoms
are not identical to each other.

The unit of the measured elastic stiffness coefficient is
"energy/distance^2"_units.html.

For a restart run where the atoms in the Green's function layer generally do not
stay at their equilibrium positions, one would better provide the mapping info
via keyword {map}.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html. 

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {temp} option is supported by this fix.
You can use it to change the temperature compute from thermo_temp to the
one that reflects the true temperature of atoms in the group.

No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this fix
for access by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.
Instead, this fix outputs the initialization information (in which the
mapping information can be found) and the calculated
elastic stiffness coefficients into file "prefix".log, where "prefix" will be
replaced by the prefix given; besides, the
elastic stiffness coefficients will also be written to file
"prefix".bin."timestep" in binary format, which could be
used by "fix gfmd"_fix_gfmd.html for Green's functions molecular
dynamics simulations. At the end of run, these information will also be written.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords
of the "run"_run.html command.

This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix assumes that the atoms in group are from one or several surface layers of a
periodical lattice.  The temperature of the system should not be too high so that
the harmonic approximation works.

[Note:] Compiling of this fix along with LAMMPS requires that 
the "FFT3d wrappers of kspace"_kspace_style.html of LAMMPS is included
while compiling.
